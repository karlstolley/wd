    <h3>Background and Ambitions (<b>Due Sep 17</b>)</h3>
    <p>
      You will write four to five paragraphs about your background as well as your ambitions for

      to make frequent commits to Git as you write.
    </p>
    <p>
      Once you have finished your plain-text version, use <code>git tag</code> to tag it as
      <code>plain-text</code>. You will then create a basic structured HTML page out of your
      plain-text work (revision to your content is allowed and encouraged), styled with a separate,
      basic stylesheet in CSS that is linked to your HTML via the <code>&lt;link&gt;</code> tag.
      Commit this also to Git as you write.

    on an agile, incremental approach to building accessible, usable, and sustainable websites that
    work across all modern browsers and web-enabled mobile devices. The course also provides a
    rhetorical and technological foundation for establishing competence in other areas of web-based
    experience design and communication, such as web application development.

  <h3>Late Work</h3>
  <p>
    I do not accept late work. All work must be submitted before the date and time specified in each
    project description.
  </p>

  <h3>Attendance and Participation</h3>
  <p>
    Your attendance and active participation are required both for your own success in the class,
    and for the success of the class as a whole. However, if you absolutely must miss, please
    contact me ahead of time via email. Students missing more than two consecutive class meetings
    will automatically fail the course.
  </p>
  <p>
    Regarding active participation: I do not give reading quizzes, but I assign a lot of reading.
    And I expect you to come prepared to discuss that reading. As evidence that you are prepared,
    you must post at least three questions you have to our Campfire room before class begins at
    6:25.
  </p>

  <h3>Academic Integrity</h3>
  <p>
    As with any course at IIT, you are expected to uphold
    <a href="http://www.iit.edu/student_affairs/handbook/information_and_regulations/code_of_academic_honesty.shtml">the Code of Academic Honesty as described in the IIT Student
    Handbook</a>. All work for this course must be your own original effort, including print and
    digital page design and computer code (in other words, you may not use readymade templates or
    WYSIWYG software in this class). Summarizations and quotations of text, as well as any use of
    open-source code libraries and images not of your own making, should be clearly cited as legally
    and ethically warranted and rhetorically appropriate. Access, storage, dissemination, and other
    use of data from third-party sources must conform to the source’s terms of service, licensing,
    and other relevant legal and ethical restrictions.
  </p>
  <p>
    If you are at all uncertain as to whether you are submitting work that in whole or in part may
    violate the Code of Academic Honesty, please contact me immediately and before the work is due.
    The consequences of academic dishonesty are severe. Any student who violates the Code of
    Academic Honesty will be subject to expulsion from this course with a failing grade, and I will
    report the student to the Chair of the Department of Humanities, who may take additional
    disciplinary action, including reporting violations to the relevant offices of Undergraduate or
    Graduate Academic Affairs.
  </p>

  <h3>Technology Policy</h3>
  <p>
    Because technology is an essential part web design and development, it is essential to this
    class. You are just as responsible for learning to command various technologies (particularly a
    plain text editor, the command-line interface, Git, as well as the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript
    languages) as for any other course content. Difficulty with technology is not an acceptable
    excuse for being unprepared for class.
  </p>
  <p>
    If you are having trouble with technology or any other material covered in this course, it is
    your professional responsibility to do research beyond the resources and guidance provided in
    class and find materials that work for you. I also encourage all students to meet with me during
    my office hours or at another arranged time outside of class or to contact me via email or
    GChat, or our Campfire room, well in advance of project deadlines.
  </p>
  <p>
    Note that coming to class with broken or malfunctioning work is far better than showing up with
    nothing but an excuse like “I just didn’t get it.” For most of the semester, it is expected that
    you’ll show up with broken work. When you’re learning, effort is more important than perfection.
    Just be sure to put in the effort early, and not the night before a project is due.
  </p>

  <h3>Accessibility and Special Needs Statement</h3>
  <p>
    Reasonable accommodations will be made for students with documented disabilities. In order to
    receive accommodations, students must obtain a letter of accommodation from the Center for
    Disability Resources. The Center for Disability Resources (CDR) is located in IIT Tower, 3424 S.
    State Street - 1C3-2. Contact the Center by telephone at 312-567-5744 or via email at
    disabilities@iit.edu
  </p>
  <p>
    Students who have any difficulty (either permanent or temporary) that might affect their ability
    to perform in class should contact me privately, either in person or via email, at the start of
    the semester or as a documented difficulty arises. Methods, materials, or deadlines will be
    adapted as necessary to ensure equitable participation for all students.
