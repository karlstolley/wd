        <h3>Course Description</h3>
        <p>
          This course introduces the theory and practice of standards-based web design and
          development. The course focuses on an agile, incremental approach to building accessible,
          usable, and sustainable web pages that work across all modern browsers and web-enabled
          mobile devices. Beyond web design, the course provides a rhetorical and technological
          foundation for quickly establishing competencies in other areas of digital communication,
          such as web application development.

      </li>
      <li>
        <h3>Course Technology Policy</h3>
        <p>
          Because technology is an essential part of web design and development, it is essential to
          this class. You are just as responsible for learning to command various technologies
          (XHTML and CSS in particular) as for any other course content. Difficulty with technology
          is not an acceptable excuse for being unprepared for class.
        </p>
        <p>
          If you are having trouble with technology or any other material covered in this course, it
          is your professional responsibility to do research beyond the resources and guidance
          provided in class and find materials that work for you. I also encourage all students to
          meet with me during my office hours or at another arranged time outside of class or to
          contact me via email or GChat well in advance of project deadlines.
        </p>
        <p>
          Note that coming to class with broken or malfunctioning work is far better than showing up
          with nothing but an excuse like “I just didn’t get it.” For most of the semester, it is
          <em>expected</em> that you’ll show up with broken work. When you’re learning, effort is
          more important than perfection. Just be sure to put in the effort early, and not the night
          before a project is due.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <h3>Attendance and Participation</h3>
        <p>
          Your attendance and active participation are required both for your own success in the
          class, and for the success of the class as a whole. However, if you absolutely must miss,
          please <a href="#contact">contact me</a> ahead of time via email.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <h3>Academic Honesty</h3>
        <p>
          As with any course at IIT, you are expected to uphold the Code of Academic Honesty (p. 48
          of the <a href="http://www.iit.edu/graduate_college/bulletin/pdfs/bulletin10-12.pdf">IIT
          Graduate Bulletin 2010-2012</a>). All work for this course should be your own original
          effort, including print and digital page design and computer code. Summarizations and
          quotations of text, as well as any use of open-source code libraries and images not of
          your own making, should be clearly cited as legally and ethically warranted and
          rhetorically appropriate.
        </p>
        <p>
          If you are at all uncertain as to whether you are submitting work that in whole or in part
          may violate the Code of Academic Honesty, please contact me immediately and before the
          work is due. The consequences of academic dishonesty are severe. Any student who violates
          the Code of Academic Honesty will be subject to expulsion from this course with a failing
          grade, and I will report the student to the Chair of the Department of Humanities and the
          Associate Dean of Graduate Academic Affairs, who may take additional disciplinary action.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <h3>Special Needs Statement</h3>
        <p>
          Reasonable accommodations will be made for students with documented disabilities. In order to receive accommodations, students must obtain a letter of accommodation from the Center for Disability Resources. The Center for Disability Resources (CDR) is located in Life Sciences Room 218. Contact the Center by telephone at 312-567-5744 or via email at disabilities@iit.edu
        </p>
        <p>
          Students who have any difficulty (either permanent or temporary) that might affect their ability to perform in class should contact me privately, either in person or via email, at the start of the semester. Methods, materials, or deadlines will be adapted as required to ensure equitable participation.
