## Course Policies

### Description

This course introduces the theory and applied practice of designing for the web according to standardized forms of the web’s core languages (HTML5, CSS, and JavaScript). The course focuses on an agile, incremental approach to building accessible, usable, and sustainable websites that work across all modern browsers and web-enabled mobile devices. The course also provides a rhetorical and technological foundation for establishing competence in other areas of web-based experience design and communication, such as web application development.

### Course Goals

1. Learn to create, prepare, and maintain web- and audience-appropriate text and media
2. Learn to structure web pages that are both valid and well-formed according to the Extensible Hypertext Markup Language (XHTML) and HTML5
3. Learn to create page designs using the Cascading Style Sheet (CSS) design language
4. Understand and implement web standards from the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C), Ecma, ISO, and other standards-issuing groups
5. Understand and apply progressive enhancement and responsive design in web development
6. Develop an agile approach to web writing and design, supplemented by the use of a version control system (Git)
7. Apply course concepts and adjust/extend course projects to fit your own academic and professional interests

### Late Work

I do not accept late work. All work must be submitted before the date and time specified in each project description.

### Attendance and Participation

Your attendance and active participation are required both for your own success in the class, and for the success of the class as a whole. However, if you absolutely must miss, please contact me ahead of time via email. Students missing more than two consecutive class meetings will automatically fail the course.

Regarding active participation: I do not give reading quizzes, but I assign a lot of reading. And I expect you to come prepared to discuss that reading. As evidence that you are prepared, you must post at least three questions you have to our Campfire room before class begins at 6:25.

### Academic Integrity

As with any course at IIT, you are expected to uphold the Code of Academic Honesty as described in the IIT Student Handbook, http://www.iit.edu/student_affairs/handbook/information_and_regulations/code_of_academic_honesty.shtml). All work for this course must be your own original effort, including print and digital page design and computer code (in other words, you may not use readymade templates or WYSIWYG software in this class). Summarizations and quotations of text, as well as any use of open-source code libraries and images not of your own making, should be clearly cited as legally and ethically warranted and rhetorically appropriate. Access, storage, dissemination, and other use of data from third-party sources must conform to the source’s terms of service, licensing, and other relevant legal and ethical restrictions.

If you are at all uncertain as to whether you are submitting work that in whole or in part may violate the Code of Academic Honesty, please contact me immediately and before the work is due. The consequences of academic dishonesty are severe. Any student who violates the Code of Academic Honesty will be subject to expulsion from this course with a failing grade, and I will report the student to the Chair of the Department of Humanities, who may take additional disciplinary action, including reporting violations to the relevant offices of Undergraduate or Graduate Academic Affairs.

### Technology Policy

Because technology is an essential part web design and development, it is essential to this class. You are just as responsible for learning to command various technologies (particularly a plain text editor, the command-line interface, Git, as well as the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript languages) as for any other course content. Difficulty with technology is not an acceptable excuse for being unprepared for class.

If you are having trouble with technology or any other material covered in this course, it is your professional responsibility to do research beyond the resources and guidance provided in class and find materials that work for you. I also encourage all students to meet with me during my office hours or at another arranged time outside of class or to contact me via email or GChat, or our Campfire room, well in advance of project deadlines.

Note that coming to class with broken or malfunctioning work is far better than showing up with nothing but an excuse like “I just didn’t get it.” For most of the semester, it is expected that you’ll show up with broken work. When you’re learning, effort is more important than perfection. Just be sure to put in the effort early, and not the night before a project is due.

### Accessibility and Special Needs Statement

Reasonable accommodations will be made for students with documented disabilities. In order to receive accommodations, students must obtain a letter of accommodation from the Center for Disability Resources. The Center for Disability Resources (CDR) is located in IIT Tower, 3424 S. State Street - 1C3-2. Contact the Center by telephone at 312-567-5744 or via email at disabilities@iit.edu

Students who have any difficulty (either permanent or temporary) that might affect their ability to perform in class should contact me privately, either in person or via email, at the start of the semester or as a documented difficulty arises. Methods, materials, or deadlines will be adapted as necessary to ensure equitable participation for all students.


## Course Calendar

### AUG 26 ESSENTIAL TOOLS: Editor, Command Line, Git; Files and Paths
Before diving into the languages of web design, we’ll work for a week with essential tools: plain-text editors and the version-control system Git along with sensibly-named and findable files and directories (folders) and their paths on the command line.

FTP isn’t the only way to publish to the web. We’ll look at using Git to deploy web-based projects.
