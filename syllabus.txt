### Description

This course introduces the theory and applied practice of designing for the web according to standardized forms of the web's core languages (HTML5, CSS, and JavaScript). The course focuses on an agile, incremental approach to building accessible, usable, and sustainable websites that work across all modern browsers and web-enabled mobile devices. The course also provides a rhetorical and technological foundation for establishing competence in other areas of web-based experience design and communication, such as web application development.

### Course Goals

Learn to create, prepare, and maintain web- and audience-appropriate text and media
Learn to structure web pages that are both valid and well-formed according to the Extensible Hypertext Markup Language (XHTML) and HTML5
Learn to create page designs using the Cascading Style Sheet (CSS) design language
Understand and implement web standards from the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C), Ecma, ISO, and other standards-issuing groups
Understand and apply progressive enhancement and responsive design in web development
Develop an agile approach to web writing and design, supplemented by the use of a version control system (Git)
Apply course concepts and adjust/extend course projects to fit your own academic and professional interests

### AUG 26 ESSENTIAL TOOLS: Editor, Command Line, Git; Files and Paths
Before diving into the languages of web design, we’ll work for a week with essential tools: plain-text editors and the version-control system Git along with sensibly-named and findable files and directories (folders) and their paths on the command line.

### SEP 02 ESSENTIAL LANGUAGES: XHTML/HTML5, CSS, JavaScript
Three languages make up the core of user-facing web design. We’ll look at the history, development, and standard usage of each.

### SEP 09 FOUNDATIONAL TECHNIQUES: Semantic Structure; Mobile First; Typographic Scales
Web design is daunting in the abstract. It can be simplified greatly by employing three foundational techniques that support mobile-friendly, future-proof pages.

Although non-text media elements deserve their own careful study and treatment, they all present a shared set of accessibility challenges for diverse users and their devices.

We revisit the typographic scale and work closely with grid-based design aided by advanced CSS3 layout techniques that gracefully degrade or rely on effective polyfills.

FTP isn’t the only way to publish to the web. We’ll look at using Git to deploy web-based projects.
