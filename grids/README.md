This is a collection of files Iâ€™m using to teach grid-based design principles in my Standards-Based Web Design class.

### Various notes to self:
  * Created column unit images with Pixelmator; a white/background layer at 20% opacity, and a gray layer (RGB 176,176,176) at 50% opacity.
  * Typo grids use colors RGB 148,209,225 and RGB 132,187,201.
