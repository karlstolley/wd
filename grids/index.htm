      <h2>Typographic Grids: Simple Concept, Tricky Execution</h2>
      <p>
        Let’s face it: people inclined toward communication and design don’t usually think of math
        as their strong suit. But the foundation of any well constructed grid is mathematical.
      </p>
      <p>
        The good news is that the only math you need is addition and multiplication. If, for
        example, your baseline grid is 18 pixels, then everything you do to enhance your design
        (borders, margin, padding) must add up to 18 pixels or a multiple of 18 (36, 54, and so on).
      </p>
      <p>
        While thinking this mathematically about design may not be fun, it also takes a lot of the
        guesswork out of design. You don’t have to worry, for example, as to what to set the
        <code>line-height</code> as on your list items or your headings or paragraphs. That’s
        already been decided.
      </p>
      <p>
        And when you do make the decision about your baseline grid, make sure that it’s an even
        number. 16, not 15. 18, not 17. The simple reason for this is that browsers will put your
        text right in the middle of the value you specify; an even number ensures that there is the
        same amount of space above and below each line of text. See also the “Mind Your Math”
        sidebar.

      <h2>Mind Your Math</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Don’t get mad, get even.</strong> When working with grids, look for numbers that
          divide evenly into both 2 and 3 (e.g. 12, 18); numbers that divide into 2 and 3 that also
          divide into 4 (e.g., 24, 32) and/or 5 (e.g., 30, 40) are even better (but harder to find
          at small intervals). Numbers that divide into 2, 3, and 6 are somewhat easier to find,
          being simply multiples of 6 (e.g., 6, 12, 18, 24).
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>A pixel might as well be a mile.</strong> They sound small, but look big. When
          creating graphics to help gauge your grid alignment, go with colored bands, not grid
          lines--as the lines themselves have dimension. This page features a <a
          href="img/18px-baseline.png">graphic</a> that's 36 pixels tall, split into two 18px-tall
          bands. Use the same technique for images that guide vertical units and columns.
