        <h3>Project 1: Resume/Vita and Portfolio Item in XHTML and Basic CSS <span>(Due September 13)</span></h3>
        <p>
          This project will be an introduction to standards-based web design. You will be creating two valid, well-formed XHTML 1.0 Strict web pages: your resume or curriculum vitae, and one item from your professional portfolio.
        </p>
        <p>
          Both of your pages will be styled via two stylesheets written in CSS: one for screen (<code>media="screen"</code>) and one for print (<code>media="print"</code>). For this project, you only have to style basic page typography and colors. (You will work on more advanced layout and design matters in Project 2.)
        </p>
        <h4>Your XHTML pages must:</h4>
        <ul>
          <li>Use the XHTML 1.0 Strict DOCTYPE</li>
          <li>Use valid, structural tags (e.g., headers, paragraphs, and lists) and <code>class</code>/<code>id</code> attributes</li>
          <li>Be hand-written and original; do not use Dreamweaver’s WYSIWYG editor or any pre-made templates, although you can start with <a href="http://gist.github.com/544075">this bare-bones skeletal XHTML file</a></li>
          <li><strong>Not</strong> use tables, except for tabular data (if you have any)</li>
          <li>Validate against the <a href="http://validator.w3.org/">W3C Markup Validation Service</a></li>
        </ul>
        <h4>Your CSS files must:</h4>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Be built over the top of a reset CSS file, such as the <a href="http://developer.yahoo.com/yui/reset/">Yahoo! Reset-Min CSS</a>
          </li>
          <li>
            Use only valid CSS 1 &amp; 2 selectors, properties, and attributes (CSS3 will be covered in Project 2)
          </li>
          <li>
            Be loaded into your XHTML pages via the <code>&lt;link&gt;</code> tag in the head area (no inline styles via the <code>style=""</code> attribute or embedded in the head with the <code>&lt;style&gt;</code> tag) using the appropriate <code>media</code> attribute value.
          </li>
          <li>
            Be hand-written and original; do not use Dreamweaver’s CSS property dialog boxes or any pre-made templates, although you should use the <a class="ext" href="http://yui.yahooapis.com/2.9.0/build/reset/reset-min.css">Yahoo! reset-min.css</a> file.
          </li>
          <li>
            Validate against the <a class="ext" href="http://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/">W3C CSS Validation Service</a>
          </li>
        </ul>
        <h4>Project Goals</h4>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Develop a clean, effective web-writing style: both in your text content, and in your source code
          </li>
          <li>
            Begin to develop a foundation in XHTML for accurately describing the structure of text
          </li>
          <li>
            Begin to develop a foundation in CSS for describing the typography and color of structural XHTML
          </li>
          <li>
            Learn to use a version control system (Git) to manage changes to your work
          </li>
        </ul>
        <h4>Deliverables and Due Dates</h4>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Your XHTML and CSS documents</strong>, posted to GitHub (draft on 9/6; final on 9/13)
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>A self-critique memo</strong> that evaluates your project and your progress in the class to this point (due 9/13 via email or as a <code>README.md</code> in your GitHub repository for the project)
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>A five-minute in-progress presentation</strong> (on 9/6) and final presentation of your project (due 9/13)
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>
        <h3>Project 2: Professional Web Presence <span>(Due November 15)</span></h3>
        <p>
          This is the major project of Standards-Based Web Design: the creation of your full
          professional web presence in a way that will allow you to continue to add to and revise
          the site into the future. Your site should include a content-rich overview page (no splash
          pages), an “about me”/biography page, your resume or vita, and at least 5 pages of
          portfolio items. You will also use CSS to add a compelling layout to your pages, enhance
          your navigation, and increase the accessibility and usability of your pages. DOM scripting
          might also be a part of your pages in a way that progressively enhances either their
          visual presentation or interactivity.
        </p>
        <h4>Your site must:</h4>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Be hosted and appear at your own openly-available URL (preferably
            <code>yourname.com</code>)
          </li>
          <li>
            Use a meaningful, search-engine-friendly URL structure
          </li>
        </ul>
        <h4>Your pages must:</h4>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Display appropriately (though not necessarily exactly the same) in Lynx, Firefox, Safari
            (or Google Chrome, if you have no Mac access), Opera, and Internet Explorer 7+ (IE);
          </li>
          <li>
            Use responsive web design techniques (e.g., media queries, scalable images, flexible
            layouts) to display on mobile, tablet, and desktop devices
          </li>
          <li>
            Make use of conditional comments to load CSS for IE, when necessary
          </li>
        </ul>
        <h4>Your XHTML must:</h4>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Feature semantic markup in a sensible source order (structured for content, not
            presentation/design)
          </li>
          <li>
            Include accessibility features, such as links for skipping to navigation or content
            sections
          </li>
          <li>
            Use the XHTML 1.0 Strict DOCTYPE
          </li>
          <li>
            Use valid, structural tags (e.g., headers, paragraphs, and lists) and
            <code>class</code>/<code>id</code> attributes
          </li>
          <li>
            Be hand-written and original; do not use Dreamweaver’s WYSIWYG editor or any pre-made
            templates, although you can start with the
            <a href="http://sustainablewebdesign.com/book/rpk/">Rapid Prototyping Kit</a>
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Not</strong> use tables, except for tabular data (if you have any)
          </li>
          <li>
            Validate against the
            <a href="http://validator.w3.org/">W3C Markup Validation Service</a>
          </li>
        </ul>
        <h4>Your CSS must:</h4>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Be built over the top of a reset CSS file, such as the
            <a href="http://developer.yahoo.com/yui/reset/">Yahoo! Reset-Min CSS</a>
          </li>
          <li>
            Use only valid CSS 1 &amp; 2 and perhaps widely-supported CSS3 selectors, properties,
            and attributes (CSS3 should only be used on the experience layer; see the Cederholm
            book, which we aren’t scheduled to read until Project 3)
          </li>
          <li>Not use hacks; use conditional comments instead</li>
          <li>
            Be loaded into your XHTML pages via the <code>&lt;link&gt;</code> tag in the head area
            (no inline styles via the <code>style=""</code> attribute or embedded in the head with
            the <code>&lt;style&gt;</code> tag) using the appropriate <code>media</code> attribute
            value.
          </li>
          <li>
            Be hand-written and original; do not use of Dreamweaver's CSS property dialog boxes or
            any pre-made templates, although you should use the <a class="ext"
            href="http://yui.yahooapis.com/2.9.0/build/reset/reset-min.css">Yahoo! reset-min.css</a>
            file.
          </li>
          <li>
            Validate against the <a class="ext" href="http://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/">W3C CSS
            Validation Service</a> (at least all CSS 1 &amp; 2; consider segregating CSS3 with
            vendor prefixes to its own file)
          </li>
        </ul>
        <h4>If you include any JavaScript/DOM Scripting, it must:</h4>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Be built using jQuery, MooTools, or another actively developed, standards-compliant
            library/framework
          </li>
          <li>
            Adhere to progressive enhancement design principles (in other words, your site must
            still work in JavaScript-less environments)
          </li>
          <li>
            Not throw any errors (e.g., in the Web Developer plugin)
          </li>
        </ul>
        <h4>Project Goals</h4>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Establish a solid and sound representation of yourself and your skills, based on your
            career or field of study/area of expertise
          </li>
          <li>
            Organize and style your professional site using responsive design techniques for maximum
            rhetorical effect under particular viewing conditions (mobile, tablet, desktop)
          </li>
          <li>
            Learn to prepare and organize appropriate materials to represent yourself on the web
          </li>
          <li>
            Learn to use CSS to control the layout and design of XHTML pages, using grid-based
            design methods for layout and typography
          </li>
          <li>
            Use, if necessary, JavaScript on the DOM to progressively enhance your pages for
            JavaScript-capable browsers and devices
          </li>
          <li>
            Learn to develop your site in a baseline browser, test in other browsers, and use
            conditional comments to address the oddities of Internet Explorer
          </li>
          <li>
            Use a version control system (Git) for agile incremental development of your site,
            including feature branches for experimentation and parallel development
          </li>
        </ul>
        <h4>Deliverables and Due Dates</h4>
        <ul>
          <li>
