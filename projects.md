### Background and Ambitions (DUE SEP 16)

You will write four to five paragraphs about your background as well as your ambitions for this class and your career at IIT and beyond. Begin by writing this in either simple plain text (`.txt`) or Markdown (`.md`) in your text-editor of choice. Be sure to make frequent commits to Git as you write.

Once you have finished your plain-text version, use `git tag` to tag it as `plain-text`. You will then create a basic structured HTML page out of your plain-text work (revision to your content is allowed and encouraged), styled with a separate, basic stylesheet in CSS that is linked to your HTML via the `<link>` tag. Commit this also to Git as you write.

#### Goals
* Learn to work with plain text and do basic HTML and CSS source-formatting
* Learn to name files for the web
* Learn to organize files in a Git repository
* Learn to share your work via GitHub
* Learn some basics of HTML and CSS
* Create a mobile-friendly, mobile-first design

#### Deliverables
* A class presentation of your work in progress (see calendar for your personal due date)
* An email to the instructor by the due date containing:
  * The https:// link to your project’s GitHub repository (email URL to instructor by due date)
  * A 4-5 paragraph self-critique (email to instructor by due date)

#### Requirements
* Valid, well-formed HTML5 and CSS
* HTML-based fallbacks for any media elements (image, audio, video) that you include
* Organized, readable source that is hand-written and original (no WYSIWYGs or code-generators)

### Single-Page Web Presence (DUE SEP 30)

You will create a mobile-first, responsively-designed single-page web presence for yourself or a club, organization, or business that you are affiliated with that currently has no web presence. If you already have a web presence that you do not wish to alter, you will create a GitHub homepage for yourself on `github.io`.

#### Goals
* Engage the rhetorical complexities of writing content for a single-page presence
* Increase your sophistication in writing HTML and CSS
* Employ mobile-first, responsive design techniques
* Design to a typographic scale
* Design to a basic grid system

#### Deliverables
* A class presentation of your work in progress (see calendar for your personal due date)
* An email to the instructor by the due date containing:
  * The https:// link to your project’s GitHub repository (email URL to instructor by due date)
  * A 4-5 paragraph self-critique (email to instructor by due date)

#### Requirements
* Valid, well-formed HTML5 and CSS
* HTML-based fallbacks for any media elements (image, audio, video) that you include
* Organized, readable source that is hand-written and original (no WYSIWYGs or code-generators)

### Redesigned Login/Sign-up Form (DUE OCT 21)

You will locate a crappy combination login/sign-up form somewhere on the web (don’t worry, they’re not hard to find). You will then create a usable, accessible and mobile-friendly redesign of the form.

### Expanded Web Presence (DUE NOV 11)

Building on your expanding capabilities with web design, you will revisit your single-page presence and expand to a multi-page or multi-page-like presence that provides greater user engagement and a stronger representation of yourself (e.g., through an online portfolio of work) or your organization (e.g., by showcasing activities, members, etc.).

### Tumblr Theme (DUE DEC 8)

You will repurpose your visual design from the Expanded Web Presence project into a Tumblr theme that adds a blogging/social component to your site or the site for your organization. You will use both HAML and SASS to create a more manageable codebase.
