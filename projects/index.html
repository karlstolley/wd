        <h3>Project One: Background and Ambitions</h3>

      <section class="description">
        <h4>Project Description</h4>
        <p>
          You will write three to four paragraphs about your background as well as your ambitions
          for this class and your career at IIT and beyond. Begin by writing this in either simple
          plain text (<code>.txt</code>) or Markdown (<code>.md</code>) in your text-editor of
          choice. Be sure to make frequent, descriptive commits in Git as you write.
        </p>
        <p>
          Once you have finished your plain-text version, use <code>git tag</code> to tag it as
          <code>plain-text</code>. You will then create a basic structured HTML page out of your
          plain-text work (revision to your content is encouraged), styled with a separate,
          basic stylesheet in CSS that is linked to your HTML via the <code>&lt;link&gt;</code> tag.
          Commit this also to Git as you write.
