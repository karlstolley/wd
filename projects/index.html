        Project One: Background and Ambitions
        <small>Due Thursday, September 14, 11:59pm&nbsp;CT</small>

      <section class="description">
        <h4>Project Description</h4>
        <p>
          You will write four to five paragraphs about your background as well as your ambitions for
          this class and your career at IIT and beyond. Begin by writing this in either simple plain
          text (<code>.txt</code>) or Markdown (<code>.md</code>) in your text-editor of choice. Be
          sure to make frequent, descriptive commits in Git as you write.
        </p>
        <p>
          Once you have finished your plain-text version, use <code>git tag</code> to tag it as
          <code>plain-text</code>. You will then create a basic structured HTML page out of your
          plain-text work (revision to your content is encouraged), styled with a separate,
          basic stylesheet in CSS that is linked to your HTML via the <code>&lt;link&gt;</code> tag.
          Commit this also to Git as you write.

          Building on your expanding capabilities with web design, you will revisit your single-page
          presence and expand to a multi-page or multi-page-like presence that provides greater user
          engagement and a stronger representation of yourself (e.g., through an online portfolio of
          work) or your organization (e.g., by showcasing activities, members, etc.).

          reflection memo for this project, a detailed list of improvements made based on shortcomings
          of the Single-Page Presence project. Single-Page Presence grades will be matched to the
