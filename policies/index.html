      <h3>Course Description</h3>
      <p>
        This course introduces the theory and applied practice of designing for the web according
        to standardized forms of the web’s core languages (HTML5, CSS, and JavaScript). The course
        focuses on an agile, incremental approach to building accessible, usable, and sustainable
        websites that work across all modern browsers and web-enabled mobile devices. The course
        also provides a rhetorical and technological foundation for establishing competence in
        other areas of web-based experience design and communication, such as web application
        development.

    <section id="assignments">
      <h3>Assignment Submission</h3>
      <p>
        All major projects for this course will be submitted via email to the instructor, at
        karl.stolley@gmail.com Draft work will be posted to Basecamp for feedback from the
        instructor and others in the class. Emails should <b>never</b> include email attachments,
        but rather URLs pointing to your project’s Git repository or, when you seeking help for a
        specific problem, a particular file or commit on GitHub. Examples will be demonstrated in
        class.
      </p>
      <h3>Late Work</h3>
      <p>
        I do not accept late work. All work must be submitted before the date and time specified in
        each project description. <b>COM 330/530 deadlines, including for draft work, are no
        different from exam dates in classes that have exams.</b> I expect you to treat them
        accordingly.
      </p>
      <h3>Participation</h3>
      <p>
        Your active participation in class and in Basecamp discussions is required both for your own
        success in the class, and for the success of the class as a whole. I do not give reading
        quizzes, but I assign a lot of reading. And I expect you to be prepared to discuss that
        reading, including on Basecamp.
      </p>
    </section>
    <section id="technology-policy">
      <h3>Course Technology Policy</h3>
      <p>
        Technology is an essential part of learning and day-to-day living. It is therefore
        essential to this class. You are just as responsible for learning to command various
        technologies as for any other course content. Difficulty with technology is never an
        acceptable excuse for being unprepared for class or late with assignments.
      </p>
      <p>
        If you are having trouble with technology or any other material covered in this course,
        it is your professional responsibility to do research beyond the resources and guidance
        provided in class and find supplemental materials that work for you. I also encourage all
        students to contact me during my office hours or at another arranged time. I prefer that you
        contact me via Basecamp Ping or email well in advance of assignment and project deadlines.
      </p>
      <p>
        Note that coming to class with broken or malfunctioning work is far better than showing
        up with nothing but an excuse like “I just didn’t get it.” For most of the semester, it
        is expected that you’ll show up with broken work. When you’re learning, effort is more
        important than perfection. Just be sure to put in the effort early, and not the night
        before a project is due.
      </p>
      <p>
        Also, I have asked you to sign up for a GitHub account for this class. Note that GitHub
        accounts are public, as are most social-type accounts. <b>To protect your privacy you are
        certainly allowed to use a pseudonym/alias for GitHub and any other account.</b> You may
        also push to repositories that you keep private, so long as you add the instructor as a
        collaborator, for grading purposes. At the same time, you might want to think about the high
        value of establishing GitHub and other accounts under your own name or professional alias.
        Public accounts where you conduct yourself professionally might well be an asset to your
        online presence, improving the search results that future schools or employers turn up when
        they look for you on Google and elsewhere.
      </p>
    </section>
    <section id="academic-integrity">
      <h3>Academic Integrity</h3>
      <p>
        As with any course at IIT, you are expected to uphold
        <a href="https://web.iit.edu/student-affairs/handbook/fine-print/code-academic-honesty">the Code of Academic Honesty</a>
        as described in the
        <a href="https://web.iit.edu/student-affairs/handbook">IIT Student Handbook</a>). All
        work for this course must be your own original effort, including print and digital page
        design and computer code. Summarizations and quotations of text, as well as any use of
        open-source code libraries and images not of your own making, should be clearly cited as
        legally and ethically warranted and rhetorically appropriate. Access, storage,
        dissemination, and other use of data from third-party sources must conform to the
        source’s terms of service, licensing, and other relevant legal and ethical restrictions.
      </p>
      <p>
        If you are at all uncertain as to whether you are submitting work that in whole or in
        part may violate the Code of Academic Honesty, please contact me immediately and before
        the work is due. The consequences of academic dishonesty are severe. Any student who
        violates the Code of Academic Honesty will be subject to expulsion from this course with
        a failing grade, and I will report the student to the Chair of the Department of
        Humanities, who may take additional disciplinary action, including reporting
        violations to the relevant offices of Undergraduate or Graduate Academic Affairs.
      </p>
    </section>
    <section id="special-needs">
      <h3>Special Needs Statement</h3>
      <p>
        I place a very high value on developing courses that are welcoming and accessible to all
        students. I will make additional reasonable accommodations for students with documented
        disabilities. In order to receive accommodations, students must obtain a letter of
        accommodation from the Center for Disability Resources. The <a
        href="https://web.iit.edu/cdr">Center for Disability Resources</a> is located in IIT Tower,
        3424 S. State Street - 1C3-2 (on the first floor). Contact the Center by telephone at
        312-567-5744, by TDD at 312-567-5135, or via email at disabilities@iit.edu
      </p>
      <p>
        Students who have any difficulty (either permanent or temporary) that might affect their
        ability to perform in class should contact me privately, either in person or electronically,
        at the start of the semester or as a documented difficulty arises. Methods, materials,
        or deadlines will be adapted as necessary to ensure equitable participation for all
        students.
