title: Late Work
---

I do not accept late work. All work must be submitted before the date and time specified in each
project description. <strong>The deadlines in this class, including for weekly and draft work, are
no different from exam dates in classes that have exams.</strong> I expect you to treat them
accordingly. If you believe you are in danger of missing a deadline, be sure to contact the
instructor well ahead of time to see if there are any options available to you. The instructor will
not negotiate with you on deadlines that are hours away or have already passed.
