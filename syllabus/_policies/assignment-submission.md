title: Assignment Submission
---

The final deliverables for all major projects in this course will be submitted via email to the
instructor, at [karl.stolley@gmail.com](mailto:karl.stolley@gmail.com). Draft work will be posted to
Basecamp for feedback from the instructor and others in the class. Emails should never include email
attachments, but rather URLs pointing to your projectâ€™s Git repository or, when you seeking help for
a specific problem, a particular file or commit on GitHub. Examples will be demonstrated in class.
