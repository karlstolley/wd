title: Technology Policy
---

Technology is an essential part of learning and day-to-day living. It is therefore essential to this
class. You are just as responsible for learning to command various technologies as for any other
course content. Difficulty with technology is never an acceptable excuse for being unprepared for
class or late with assignments.

If you are having trouble with technology or any other material covered in this course, it is your
professional responsibility to do research beyond the resources and guidance provided in class and
find supplemental materials that work for you. I also encourage all students to contact me during my
office hours or at another arranged time. I prefer that you contact me via Basecamp Ping or email
well in advance of assignment and project deadlines.

Note that coming to class with broken or malfunctioning work is far better than showing up with
nothing but an excuse like “I just didn’t get it.” For most of the semester, it is expected that
you’ll show up with broken work. When you’re learning, effort is more important than perfection.
Just be sure to put in the effort early, and not the night before a project is due.

Also, I have asked you to sign up for a GitHub account for this class. Note that GitHub accounts are
public, as are most social-type accounts. <strong>To protect your privacy you are certainly allowed
to use a pseudonym/alias for GitHub and any other account.</strong> You may also push to
repositories that you keep private, so long as you add the instructor as a collaborator, for grading
purposes. At the same time, you might want to think about the high value of establishing GitHub and
other accounts under your own name or professional alias. Public accounts where you conduct yourself
professionally might well be an asset to your online presence, improving the search results that
future schools or employers turn up when they look for you on Google and elsewhere.
