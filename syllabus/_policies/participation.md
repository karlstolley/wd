title: Attendance & Participation
---

Your timely submission of work and active participation in the electronic discussions for this class
are required both for your own success and for the success of the class as a whole. I do not
squander students’ time with reading quizzes, but I do assign a lot of reading. And I expect you to
be prepared to discuss that reading on Basecamp by quoting or making direct references to each
week’s assigned reading.

Students intending to earn an A for Participation should be posting substantively on Basecamp five
times or more per week, with contributions appearing multiple days per week, all semester long.
Students earning a B will post three to five times, and students earning a C will post two times,
every week. Fewer than an average of two discussion contributions per week will result in a failing
Participation grade.
