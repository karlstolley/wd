<h4>Required</h4>

- A blank, bound paper sketchbook of 100 pages or more
- An email account that you check regularly
- A browser- or cloud-based bookmarking scheme to aid your information management
- A Basecamp account (invite will arrive via email); Basecamp, not Blackboard, will be where we
  coordinate our work and communication in- and outside of class
- A GitHub account (see note about anonymity in the course technology policy below)
- The domain of your name (e.g., stolley.co belongs to the instructor) or, if privacy is a concern,
  the domain for your public alias
- A personal computer, ideally Unix-based (Linux, BSD, OS X), with the following software installed:
  - A plain-text editor capable of syntax highlighting; set up to use UTF-8/Unicode character
    encoding and Unix-style line endings (LF), entabbed with spaces (two spaces per tab). I
    recommend Atom.io, if you are looking for a recommendation.
  - Firefox Developer Edition (free)
  - Git (free)
  - Node.js (free)
  - Image-editing software (such as the free and open-source GIMP)
  - As many different browsers as your operating system supports (e.g., Chrome, Opera, Firefox,
    Vivaldi; all free)
