This course introduces the theory and applied practice of designing for the web according to the
most recent, standardized forms of the webâ€™s core languages (HTML, CSS, and JavaScript). The course
focuses on an agile, incremental approach to building accessible, usable, and sustainable websites
that work across all modern browsers and web-enabled mobile devices. The course also provides a
rhetorical and technological foundation for establishing competence in other areas of web-based
design and communication, such as web application development.
