title: Academic Integrity
---

As with any course at IIT, you are expected to uphold [the Code of Academic
Honesty](https://web.iit.edu/student-affairs/handbook/fine-print/code-academic-honesty) as described
in [the IIT Student Handbook](https://web.iit.edu/student-affairs/handbook). All work for this
course must be your own original effort, including print and digital page design and computer code.
Summarizations and quotations of text, as well as any use of open-source code libraries and images
not of your own making, should be clearly cited as legally and ethically warranted and rhetorically
appropriate. Access, storage, dissemination, and other use of data from third-party sources must
conform to the sourceâ€™s terms of service, licensing, and other relevant legal and ethical
restrictions.

If you are at all uncertain as to whether you are submitting work that in whole or in part may
violate the Code of Academic Honesty, please contact me immediately and before the work is due. The
consequences of academic dishonesty are severe. Any student who violates the Code of Academic
Honesty will be subject to expulsion from this course with a failing grade, and I will report the
student to the Chair of the Department of Humanities, who may take additional disciplinary action,
including reporting violations to the relevant offices of Undergraduate or Graduate Academic
Affairs.
