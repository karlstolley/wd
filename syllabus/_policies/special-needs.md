title: Special Needs

I place a very high value on developing courses that are welcoming and accessible to all students. I
will make additional reasonable accommodations for students with documented disabilities. In order
to receive accommodations, students must obtain a letter of accommodation from the Center for
Disability Resources. [The Center for Disability Resources](https://web.iit.edu/cdr) is located in
IIT Tower, 3424 S. State Street - 3F3-1 (third floor, in the northwest corner across from the
Student Health and Wellness Center). Contact the Center by telephone at 312-567-5744, by TDD at
312-567-5135, or via email at [disabilities@iit.edu](mailto:disabilities@iit.edu)

Students who have any difficulty, either permanent or temporary, that might affect their ability to
successfully participate in and complete the class should contact me privately, either in person or
electronically, at the start of the semester or as a documented difficulty arises. I will adjust
methods, materials, or deadlines as necessary to ensure equitable participation for all students.

<h4>Mental Health and Wellness</h4>

Itâ€™s no secret that attending school while managing and balancing other life concerns is incredibly
stressful and at times completely overwhelming. All of us, no matter how outwardly strong,
successful, or put-together we might appear, struggle sometimes. Illinois Tech provides all students
with a variety of free counseling services. I encourage all students to seek support and help from
the [Counseling Services](https://web.iit.edu/shwc/services/counseling-services) unit of the Student
Health and Wellness Center. Students facing a crisis situation may wish to call the [National
Suicide Prevention Lifeline](https://suicidepreventionlifeline.org/) at 1-800-273-8255. The Student
Health and Wellness Center maintains [a list of other emergency
resources](https://web.iit.edu/shwc/services/crisis-services/emergency-resources) worth bookmarking.
