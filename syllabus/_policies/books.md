<aside class="fine-print" markdown="1">
  <b>My policy for assigning books:</b> Required books are all required in the edition indicated;
  the total retail price tag for the entire course should be less than $100 (this one is $89 on the
  high end); and each book should be worthy of a place on your bookshelf or electronic device of
  choice long after the class has ended.

  I want to help you build your professional library while also being sensitive to your personal
  finances. While many things about the course calendar may change, the reading schedule will not. I
  invite you to hold off on purchasing specific books until closer to the time that we read them.
