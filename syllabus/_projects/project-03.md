Building on your expanding web design abilities, you will revisit your single-page presence and
expand it to a multi-page or multi-page-like presence that provides greater user engagement and a
stronger representation of yourself (e.g., through an online portfolio of work) or your organization
(e.g., by showcasing activities, members, etc.).
