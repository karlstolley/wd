Based on feedback from Project Three and your own personal ambitions, you will make additional
revisions and improvements to your site based on your work for Project Three. You will also deploy
your site to a public URL, if you have not done so previously.

Additionally, students enrolled in COM 530 must attempt to implement some advanced feature to extend
their site’s sophistication or functionality. That work does not need to be implemented into the
deployed site; a feature branch in the site’s GitHub repository will suffice. COM 530 students
unsure of what kind of feature to pursue should consult with the instructor.
