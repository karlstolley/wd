You will create a mobile-first, responsively designed single-page web presence for yourself for or a
club, organization, or business that you are affiliated with that currently has no web presence. If
you already have a web presence that you do not wish to alter, you will create a GitHub homepage for
yourself on `github.io` using [GitHub pages](https://pages.github.com/).
