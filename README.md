I always start a class with a finished course website, but this time around I've decided to model the process of working with plain text and shaping a website. Also, as it evolves, the course website will reflect the material that has been covered so far, giving students an indication of what they should be capable of at any given week in the semester.

The material/site for COM327 (undergraduate section) is on the `master` branch; the graduate section, COM530, is on the `530` branch.

Both courses are available on the web, too:

* http://courses.karlstolley.com/327/
* http://courses.karlstolley.com/530/
